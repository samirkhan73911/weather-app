i have used openweather api in this weather app project.
used html css javascrpt bootstrap and some media queries for better user intrection and  responsiveness.
weather ap which show current weather updates icon, temprature, feels like, humidity, sunset, sunrise, wind speed and visibilty.
by default it shows the weather of islamabad but you can search any city by puting city name in search bar. 
by clicking on "C" and "F" it will show the "temprature" and "feels like" in Celsius or Fahrenheit accordingly.
